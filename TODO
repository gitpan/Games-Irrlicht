* The Makefile.pL and assorted stuff is totally botched. I could not get
  MakeMaker to generated code that will compile or link. So I tricked it
  with a hand-rolled batch job (./m) and since make test always compiled
  the non-working version, call ./ from t/00.t as the first thing.
  Ugh!

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
