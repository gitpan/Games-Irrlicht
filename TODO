Games::Irrlicht

* Games::Irrlicht should get you access to the driver, device, filemanager etc
  and then let you call functions on them. While this works, it really is just
  a fake front, you could call all functions directly. They need to live in
  their own cozy namespace.
* The techdemo should be converted to Perl just to show we can do it
* There are too many functions not working yet

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
