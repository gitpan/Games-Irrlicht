Games::Irrlicht

* Games::Irrlicht should get you access to the driver, device, filemanager etc
  and then let you call functions on them. Currently all functions from them
  are global, which won't work in the long run.
* The techdemo should be converted to Perl just to show we can do it

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
