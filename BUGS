* running "make test" hangs in t/myirrlicht.t, while perl t/myirrlicht.t works
  (huh?) (this is some problem with the nanosleep)
* resizable is not supported
* fullscreen does not seem to work
* screenshots not yet possible
* the entire EventHandler code needs revamping due to SDL_KEYDOWN vs. whatever
  Irrlicht uses
* The framerate wait-delay stuff (nanosleep) does not work like it should

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
